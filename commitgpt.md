The purpose of this document is to provide you with a tool for automatically generating commit messages.

As Git changes are executed on your local computer, please run the following commands within your local environment.


## **Preparation**
Install shell_gpt

```pip install shell-gpt```

If you have GPT-4, you can update the configuration by adding your OpenAI API key to the ```~/.config/shell_gpt/.sgptrc``` file.

```
[...]
DEFAULT_MODEL=gpt-4
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
[...]
```

## **Role**
Introduce a new role called ```commitgpt``` which will serve as the ChatGPT prompt.
```
$ sgpt --create-role commitgpt
Enter role description:
Compose a concise Git commit header with a maximum of 50 characters, don't add double quotes,
summarizing the changes made. If necessary and relevant, provide additional details in bullet points below the header.
Ensure that the additional details are wrapped at 72 characters per line, following Git commit best practices.
Your input will always be a git diff representing the changes. Focus on maintaining clear communication and a clean
code history for any project you're involved in.

Enter expecting result, e.g. answer, code, shell command, command description, etc.:
answer
```


## Usage
Once you've completed the code update, execute the diff command and then pass its output to the sgpt role.

```
git diff HEAD | sgpt --role commitgpt
```

## Advanced Usage
Learn how to separate and manage stage and unstaged commits for power users.

```
# staged
git diff --cached | sgpt --role commitgpt
# unstaged
git diff | sgpt --role commitgpt
```

## Advanced Power Usage
Enhance your experience as a power user by setting up aliases in your shell environment (e.g., .zshenv) and directing the output to the clipboard.

### MacOS
```
 alias commitgpt="git diff HEAD | sgpt --role commitgpt | pbcopy"
 alias commitgpt-staged="git diff --cached | sgpt --role commitgpt | pbcopy"
 alias commitgpt-unstaged="git diff | sgpt --role commitgpt | pbcopy"
```
### Linux
```
 alias commitgpt="git diff HEAD | sgpt --role commitgpt | xclip"
 alias commitgpt-staged="git diff --cached | sgpt --role commitgpt | xclip"
 alias commitgpt-unstaged="git diff | sgpt --role commitgpt | xclip"
```
